# tn

This is a command-line program for keeping your own journals, written in
[Haskell][hs] and licensed under the [ISC license][iscl]. You can find a
copy of the ISC license in the [LICENSE file][license-file]

## Installing

The version on Hackage is out of date, and also really terrible, so
don't try to `cabal install tn` just yet. You'll need [git][git-install]
and [The Haskell Stack][hs-stack].

    git clone https://github.com/pharpend/tn.git
    cd tn
    stack setup
    stack install

I welcome any contributions anyone wants to make. If you find a bug or a
feature request, use the [GitHub bug tracker][issues]. If you want to
contribute, use the normal method of contributing to projects on GitHub.
